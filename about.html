        About GamePlayersHub</h1>
    <p>
        GamePlayersHub is a source for video game news and reviews. Video game reviews are
        rated on a percentage scale. You may notice that the scores are colored differently.
        The colors are based on the visible light spectrum to go with the galactic theme.
        Isn't that great? If you're still thinking about that one, the answer is "yes, it's
        great". Moving on... The colors for ratings are attributed based on the red-shift
        and blue-shift observed in the Doppler Effect. When a light source moves away from
        an observer the electromagnetic wavelength increases causing it to shift toward
        the red end of the spectrum, conversely when a light source moves toward an observer
        the electromagnetic wavelength decreases causing it to shift toward the blue end
        of the spectrum. Basically, blue comes toward you and red moves away from you. It
        doesn't have any purpose here other than going along with the galactic theme, and
        I'm extremely nerdy; and this project is being graded so I had to include unnecessary
        crap to make excusess for using more CSS.

                This is a terrible, awful game. It's bad, bad, bad. Pretend it doesn't exist and
                move on with your life.</p>

                You could buy it, but you'll just end up using the disc as a beverage coaster.</p>

                This is pretty bad, but you might at least get a good laugh out of how bad it is.</p>

                        This is a terrific, wonderful game. It's good, good, good. Buy 1000 of them, play
                        one, and build a fort with the rest.</p>
